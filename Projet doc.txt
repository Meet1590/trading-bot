1> Initialized repo using VS codes GUI on the 4th icon in rop left corner
    -> Tried to create new branch named DEV using command pallate but showed,
        FATAL error as follows'HEAD' is not a commit and a branch 'dev' cannot be created from it
    Solution: Therefore I created Porject doc text file and commiting it with a first message.

2> Created dev branch using command pallate - (All branch name should be in lowercase for maintainability purpose)
    -> 2nd commit in main branch with updated text file.
